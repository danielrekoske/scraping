       "    'description': \"Conventional area is any area that does not require the sale of reformulated gasoline. All types of finished motor gasoline may be sold in this area. RFG area is an ozone nonattainment area designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which requires the use of reformulated gasoline. We stopped publishing Low Sulfur On-Highway Diesel (LSD) prices at the U.S. level on December 8, 2008, because fewer stations were selling LSD as a result of EPA diesel fuel regulations. We continued to collect LSD prices from retail outlets and included them in the Diesel Average All Types price until July 26, 2010, when no more outlets reported LSD sales. Beginning July 26, 2010, publication of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) price became fully represented by the Diesel Average All Types price. As of December 1, 2010 (September 1, 2006 in California), any on-highway diesel fuel sold is ULSD as mandated by EPA on-highway diesel fuel regulations. We did not collect weekly retail motor gasoline data between December 10, 1990, and January 14, 1991. Monthly and annual averages are simple averages of the weekly data. For months and years with incomplete weekly data series, the monthly and/or annual averages are not available. On May 14, 2018, we implemented <a href ='https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gas_proc-methods.php' class='reg'>statistical methodology changes</a> to improve the accuracy of the weekly retail gasoline price estimates. As a result of these statistical methodology changes, the published retail gasoline estimates for May 14, 2018, are not directly comparable to those published for May 7, 2018. On June 13, 2022, we implemented <a href ='https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/diesel_proc-methods.php' class='reg'>statistical methodology changes</a> to improve the accuracy of the weekly retail on-highway diesel fuel price estimates. As a result of these statistical methodology changes, the published retail on-highway diesel fuel prices for June 13, 2022 are not directly comparable to those published for June 6, 2022.\"},\n",
